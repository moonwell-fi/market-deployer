ðŸŒ• **Moonwell Market Deployer** allows users to deploy Moonwell Contracts with a simple CLI.

The Moonwell Market Deployer is optimized to be easy to use, with minimal technical knowledge required. A [sample run of
the program is available here](docs/sample-run.md).

# Setup

Users who are comfortable with a CLI should be able to get going by following the following steps. Simply install If you have trouble,
consult the [in-depth installation guide](docs/installation.md).

```shell
nvm use 18 # Node 18+ required
npm i -g @moonwell-fi/market-deployer # Get the CLI tool
